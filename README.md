MetaNuclear

MetaNuclear is a cutting-edge project aimed at creating a virtual reality (VR) simulation of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). This simulation allows users to experience and interact with a realistic, fully functional nuclear power plant environment. The project is designed to serve as a training and educational tool for nuclear engineering students, professionals, and enthusiasts.

 Key Features:
- Immersive Experience:Users can explore a virtual nuclear power plant, interact with equipment, and perform tasks typically carried out by nuclear engineers.
-Educational Tool: MetaNuclear offers a safe, virtual environment for students to practice and apply their knowledge without the risks associated with real-world nuclear power plants.
- Collaborative Learning: The project supports collaborative learning and training sessions, enabling interaction between users from around the globe.
- IoT Integration:Future plans include integrating IoT technology to allow for remote control and monitoring of the virtual plant, enhancing the realism and educational value of the simulation.
